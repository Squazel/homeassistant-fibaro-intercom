üõ†Ô∏è  FIBARO Intercom Development CLI

Usage: python hass-dev <command>

Commands:
  setup        - Set up development environment (run this first!)
  format       - Format code with ruff
  lint         - Run linting checks (advisory mode)
  lint-strict  - Run linting checks (strict mode)
  test         - Run the test suite with pytest
  quality      - Run format + lint (no tests)
  check        - Run all checks (format + lint + test)
  check-strict - Run all checks with strict type checking

Examples:
  python hass-dev setup       # First-time setup
  python hass-dev format      # Just format the code
  python hass-dev quality     # Quick quality check (no tests)
  python hass-dev check       # Full check before committing

üí° Tip: Use 'quality' for quick feedback, 'check' before committing
